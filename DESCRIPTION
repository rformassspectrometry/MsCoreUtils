Package: MsCoreUtils
Title: Core Utils for Mass Spectrometry Data
Version: 1.9.2
Description: MsCoreUtils defines low-level functions for mass
    spectrometry data and is independent of any high-level data
    structures. These functions include mass spectra processing
    functions (noise estimation, smoothing, binning), quantitative
    aggregation functions (median polish, robust summarisation, ...),
    missing data imputation, data normalisation (quantiles, vsn, ...)
    as well as misc helper functions, that are used across high-level
    data structure within the R for Mass Spectrometry packages.
